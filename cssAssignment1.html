    <!-- Poem Name -->
    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <!-- Poet's Name -->
    <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land <br>
        Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
        Stand in the desart.[d] Near them, on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: <br>
        And on the pedestal these words appear: <br>
        "My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings: <br>
        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br>
        No thing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away. <br>
    </p>
